------------------------------------------
--- 1. Prepare the wrapper and libraries
------------------------------------------
--- Create a directory to contain python sources. For example ~/pysrc.
$ mkdir ~/pysrc
--- Chdir to the new directory 
$ cd ~/pysrc
--- checkout pylipap first and 
--- prepare the wrapper program from pylibap
$ git clone https://github.com/py3sourcesForAdministration/pylibap.git 
--- if you have a writable bin directory which is in your path go there
--- usually this is ~/bin
$ cd ~/bin
$ ln -s ../pysrc/pylibap/pywrap.py pywrapper
--- Now create a link to the basename of the wanted program.py
$ ln -s pywrapper uyu

------------------------------------------
--- 2. Clone this program
------------------------------------------
--- chdir again to the source directory and clone this project
$ cd ~/pysrc
$ git clone https://github.com/py3sourcesForAdministration/uyuni.git 

------------------------------------------
--- 3. Configure this program
------------------------------------------
$ cd ~pysrc/uyuni
--- Create your private configuration, must start with SRV- 
$ cp SRV.example.cfg SRV-myconf.cfg
$ ln -s SRV-myconf.cfg SRV-default.cfg
--- you can now either change the settings in SRV-myconf.cfg to
--- reflect your needs or check whether everything is ok 
--- If you got all modules for python
--- See uyu_imp.py which modules are needed you can run
--- uyu via the wrapper.
--- Lets check with
$ uyu -h 
--- you should see the help messages and 
$ uyu -l
--- which should show the available modules


------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------
All configuration is done in  SRV-myconf.cfg. Read the documention
provided in this file to adopt to your environment.
